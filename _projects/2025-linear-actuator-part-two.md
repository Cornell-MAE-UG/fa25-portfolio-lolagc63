**Project goal:** 
 Choose a beam design (cross-section, material) such that its vertical deflection is below 2% of its length and is the most mass-efficient possible.

## Overview / assumptions
1. Geometry used: selected configuration L = 1.20m, tip height y_tip = 0.50m
2. Beam modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam
3. Boundary condition: fixed at pivot (assumed stiff enough to provide rotational restraint)
4. Loads included (transverse components only):
    - Tip vertical load W = 31, 630 N 
    - Actuator Peak Thrust (F_a): 35,810 N; only its component perpendicular to the beam at the actuator point P is used for bending
5. Material: steel, E = 200GPa, ρ = 7850 kg/m^3
6. Allowable tip vertical deflection = 2% of L = 0.02L
